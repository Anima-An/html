                    <p><em>BMW e60</em> is part of the fifth generation of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series>BMW 5 series</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_car">executive cars</a> that consist of the BMW E60 (saloon version) and BMW E61 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring').
                     This generation was produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW">BMW</a> from 2003 till 2010 and is often referred as the E60.</p>
                    <p>The E60 introduced various new electronic features such as active cruise control, active stearing, adaptive headlights, night vison and lane departure warning. The E60 was also the first 5 series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmisson and regenerative braking.</p>
                    <p>The M5 model was introduced in 2005 and is powered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_S85">BMW S85</a> V10 engine. It was soldin the saloon and wagon body styles, with most using the 7-speed SMG III transmisson. It was the first and only M5 model to be sold with the V10 engine. </p>

                    <h2>Engines</h2>

                    <h3>Petrol</h3>
                    <p>At launch, the E60 used the E39 5 Series' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M54">M54</a> straight 6 engine in the 520i, 525i and the 530i models. Thew only petrol models with the new engnine at lauch was the 545i with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_N62">N62</a> V8. The M54 was taken out 
                    after the 2005 model years and replaced by the straight 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_N43">N43</a> (in the 520i) and the straight 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_N52">N52</a> engine (in the 525i and 530i). The model range was expanded the same year to include a wider range of models like the 523i, 540i and 550i.
                    In 2007, the only turbocharged petrol E60 model was introduced, the 535i with the twin-turbo straight 6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_N54">N54</a> engine though this model was exclusive only to the North American market and was not sold in Europe.</p>
